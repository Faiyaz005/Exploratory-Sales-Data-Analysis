# Exploratory-Sales-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on 'Diwali Sales Data' using Python and Jupyter Notebook

In this project, I have cleaned and filtered 'Diwali Sales Data' and conducted exploratory data analysis on topics such as:
1) Age
2) Gender
3) Ocupation
4) State
5) Marital Status etc.
   
I have used python libraries such as Pandas, Matplolib, Seaborn and NumPy to answer questions related to sales data with both graphs and written explanations, which can be used to further analyse the potential customer base for the firm to target in their possible upcoming marketing campaign.
